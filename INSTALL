=head1 NAME

INSTALL - How to install Kx

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is experimental at the moment. Mark developed it on MacOSX and Linux,
x86. And now my (Stephan's) development platform is Linux (x64).

You need to first get a copy of c.o from L<https://github.com/KxSystems/kdb>
(for example for Linux x64 it's L<https://github.com/KxSystems/kdb/blob/master/l64/c.o>)
for your architecture. Make libkdb.a from c.o for easy linking like below in the
same path as the package source.

    ar -r libkdb.a c.o

or
    libtool -static -o libkdb.a c.o

For make test to actually do anything, you need to have a 'q' process
running on localhost port 2222 (or other port specified by environment
variable C<KX_PORT>).

    q -p 2222
